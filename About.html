        <h1 style="font-size: 35px; color: aqua; font-family: sans-serif;">Hello, let me tell you more about myself</h1><br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">My name is Juhel Miah and I'm a junior software developer. 

            Let me start from the beginning... I started my journey studying law, I enjoyed it but decided not to 
            pursue a career in law. I've been trying to find my feet ever since. I've done various customer service, 
            admin and advice roles, but there was always one thing that kept niggling at me... Get into TECH!
            From my dad to my friends, I've heard them all pushing me towards tech. <br><br>

            For one reason or another I kept putting it off, mainly because I felt I cannot do it.
            Well, I finally mustered the courage to make the jump in February 2023! And boy do I realise now what I've been 
            missing! <br><br>
            
            I recently completed a software development bootcmamp with JustIT.
            During my time there, I gained so much experience in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS and MS Azure Fundamentals. 
            I also had the opportunity to work on various projects. <br><br>
            
            Now I can confidently say that I know what I want to do for a living. I have gained so much knowledge in the matter of a few weeks.
            <br><br>
            I'm so passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve people's lives.
            <br><br>
            I'm now looking to break into the tech world!
